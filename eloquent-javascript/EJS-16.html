    <h3>Content Negotiation</h3>
    <p>
      One of the things HTTP can do is called content negotiation. The Accept
      request header is used to tell the server what type of document the client
      would like to get. Many servers ignore this header, but when a server
      knows of various ways to encode a resource, it can look at this header and
      send the one that the client prefers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The URL https://eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond
      with either plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks
      for. These formats are identified by the standardized media types
      text/plain, text/html, and application/json.
    </p>

    <p>
      Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the headers
      property in the options object passed to fetch to set the header named
      Accept to the desired media type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and
      see which status code that produces.

    <h2>A JavaScript WorkBench</h2>

    <p>
      Build an interface that allows people to type and run pieces of JavaScript
      code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put a button next to a &lt;textarea&gt; field that, when pressed, uses the
      Function constructor we saw in Chapter 10 to wrap the text in a function
      and call it. Convert the return value of the function, or any error it
      raises, to a string and display it below the text field.
    </p>

    <textarea id="code">return "hi";</textarea>
    <button id="button">Run</button>
    <pre id="output"></pre>

    <h2>Conway’s Game of Life</h2>

    <p>
      Conway’s Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial
      “life” on a grid, each cell of which is either alive or not. Each
      generation (turn), the following rules are applied:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors
        dies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
        generation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent
      ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one
      square at a time. That means the counting of neighbors is based on the
      situation at the start of the generation, and changes happening to
      neighbor cells during this generation should not influence the new state
      of a given cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implement this game using whichever data structure you find appropriate.
      Use Math.random to populate the grid with a random pattern initially.
      Display it as a grid of checkbox fields, with a button next to it to
      advance to the next generation. When the user checks or unchecks the
      checkboxes, their changes should be included when computing the next
      generation.
    </p>
