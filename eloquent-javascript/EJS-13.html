    <h1>Balloon</h1>
    <p>
      Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, üéà). When
      you press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, and when you
      press the down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the font-size
      CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element. Remember to include a
      unit in the value‚Äîfor example, pixels (10px).
    </p>
    <p>
      The key names of the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make sure
      the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a
      certain size, it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is
      replaced with an üí• emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you
      can‚Äôt inflate or deflate the explosion).
    </p>

    <p id="balloon">üéà</p>
    <script>
      const balloon = document.getElementById("balloon");
      let size = 18;
      window.addEventListener("keydown", function blow(event) {
        if (size >= 50) {
          balloon.textContent = "üí•";
          window.removeEventListener("keydown", blow);
        }
        if (event.key == "ArrowUp") {
          size *= 1.1;
        }
        if (event.key == "ArrowDown") {
          size = size > 10 ? (size *= 0.9) : 10;
        }
        balloon.style.fontSize = size + "px";
        event.preventDefault();
      });
    </script>

    <h1>Mouse trail</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript‚Äôs early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages
      with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring
      ways to use the language.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of these was the mouse trail‚Äîa series of elements that would follow
      the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely
      positioned &lt;div&gt; elements with a fixed size and background color
      (refer to the code in the ‚ÄúMouse Clicks‚Äù section for an example). Create a
      bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake
      of the mouse pointer.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as
      simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to
      keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the
      next one to the mouse‚Äôs current position every time a "mousemove" event
      occurs.
    </p>
    <style>
      .trail {
        /* className for the trail elements */
        position: absolute;
        height: 6px;
        width: 6px;
        border-radius: 3px;
        background: teal;
      }
      body {
        height: 300px;
      }
    </style>

    <script>
      const trailItems = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        const item = document.createElement("div");
        item.className = "trail";
        trailItems[i] = item;
      }
      trailItems.forEach((item) => document.body.appendChild(item));
      let counter = 0;
      window.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
        counter == trailItems.length - 1 ? (counter = 0) : counter++;
        trailItems[counter].style.left = event.pageX + 23 + "px";
        trailItems[counter].style.top = event.pageY - 23 + "px";
      });
    </script>

    <h1>Tabs</h1>
    <p>
      Tabbed panels are widely used in user interfaces. They allow you to select
      an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs ‚Äústicking out‚Äù above
      an element.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this exercise you must implement a simple tabbed interface. Write a
      function, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface
      showing the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of
      &lt;button&gt; elements at the top of the node, one for each child
      element, containing text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute of the
      child. All but one of the original children should be hidden (given a
      display style of none). The currently visible node can be selected by
      clicking the buttons.
    </p>

    <p>
      When that works, extend it to style the button for the currently selected
      tab differently so that it is obvious which tab is selected.
    </p>

    <tab-panel>
      <div data-tabname="one">Tab one</div>
      <div data-tabname="two">Tab two</div>
      <div data-tabname="three">Tab three</div>
    </tab-panel>
    <script>
      function asTabs(node) {
        let tabs = Array.from(node.children).map((node) => {
          let button = document.createElement("button");
          button.textContent = node.getAttribute("data-tabname");
          let tab = { node, button };
          button.addEventListener("click", () =>  selectTab(tab));
          return tab;
        });

        let tabList = document.createElement("div");
        for (let { button } of tabs) {
          tabList.appendChild(button);
        }
        node.insertBefore(tabList, node.firstChild);

        function selectTab(selectedTab) {
          for (let tab of tabs) {
            let selected = tab == selectedTab;
            tab.node.style.display = selected ? "" : "none";
            tab.button.style.color = selected ? "red" : "";
          }
        }
        selectTab(tabs[0]);
      }
      asTabs(document.querySelector("tab-panel"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
